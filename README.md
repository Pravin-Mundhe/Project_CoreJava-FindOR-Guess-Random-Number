# Project_CoreJava-FindOR-Guess-the-random-Number
//This project is used to find or guess the random number generated(1-100). We will generate the random number using
// random function and will ask the user to guess the random number. We will take the input from the user untill the user's
//input is equal to the random number. Here, we have provided two versions of the solution. In the first solution, we have strictly considered the numbers from 1 to 100 only. In the second version, we have considered the user input except the range 1-100. In this case, we have given only three attempts to enter the input, otherwise program will exit.
